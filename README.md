# Climo
Climo is an open source and minimalist wether app, developed in android studio using Java and [WetherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). 
## For Developers
Welcome to Climo, the minimalist and open source weather app. In order to maintain privacy and avoid overloading the API, you need to request a key in [WetherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) using the **Free plan**.

### ¿How do I use my key on the app?
1. Go to your file **local.propieties**.
2. Add this line to the file (`your_key` is the key that you have from [WetherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)).:

```
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_key
```
3. Save the file and run the app.

### ¿What Android Virtual Device I should run?
To develop the app, an **Pixel 9 API 33** has been used, runing **Android 13 "Tiramisu"** but the app should be able to run on any device with an API **greater than or equal to 24**.
