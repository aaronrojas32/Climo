## **For Contributors & Developers**
Welcome to Climo! Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. To ensure privacy and API efficiency, you need to obtain your own API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) using their **Free Plan**.

### **How to Use Your WeatherAPI Key**
1. Create a file `apikeys.xml` file under the directory `res/values/`.
2. Replace the placeholder `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your WeatherAPI key:
   ```xml
   <resources>
       <string name="weather_api_key">YOUR_API_KEY</string>
   </resources>
   ```
3. Save the file and run the app in your preferred Android Virtual Device.

### **Android Virtual Device (AVD) Recommendation**
For development and testing purposes, the app has been optimized for:
- **Device:** Pixel 9
- **API Level:** 33
- **Android Version:** Android 13 ("Tiramisu")

However, Climo is designed to run on any Android device with an API **greater than or equal to 24** (Android 7.0 "Nougat").
